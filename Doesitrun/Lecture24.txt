INPUT AND OUTPUT IN A JAGGED ARRAY
==================================
We leave one square bracket empty.

import java.util.Scanner;
class Jagged2DArr{

    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[][]arr = new int[3][];
        arr[0] = new int[4];
        arr[1] = new int[2];
        arr[2] = new int[5];
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    }
    for(int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j< arr[i].length; j++){
            System.out.println("Enter number: ");
            arr[i][j] = sc.nextInt();
        }
    }
    for(int i = 0; i<arr.length; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j< arr[i].length; j++){
            System.out.println("Numbers are : " + arr[i][j]);
        }
    }
}

ASSIGNMENTS
=============
WAP to calculate average sales made by every salesman of a company.
Number of salesmen, number of sales, and sale value amount
all have to be accepted from the user.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
HOW MANY SALESMEN?
3

HOW MANY SALES FOR SALESMAN 1?
3
ENTER SALE 1 VALUE:30
ENTER SALE 2 VALUE:10
ENTER SALE 3 VALUE:50

HOW many SALES FOR SALESMAN2?
2
ENTER SALE 1 VALUE:30
ENTER SALE 2 VALUE:10

HOW many SALES FOR SALESMAN3?
3
ENTER SALE 1 VALUE:30
ENTER SALE 2 VALUE:10
ENTER SALE 3 VALUE: 5

AVERAGE SALE OF SALESMAN1: ...
AVERAGE SALE OF SALESMAN2: ...
AVERAGE SALE OF SALESMAN3: ...
//this program runs for n salesmen
PART 2

ALSO OUTPUT THE BEST SALESMAN.
THE BEST IS THE ONE WITH THE HIGHEST AVERAGE SALES.
THIS TAKES JAGGED ARRAYS



OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
===========================
//SEE SIRS CRASH COURSE YOUTUBE VIDEO FOR OOP ON THERE
//THE REFRESHER CLASS FROM C++ IS THERE ON YOUTUBE

Q.
WHAT IS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?
A.
1.IT IS A METHODOLOGY/APPROACH OF DEVELOPING SOFTWARE IN TODAYS world
MAXIMUM SOFTWARE TODAY IS MADE THROUGH THE OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING APPROACH

2. IN THIS EVERY COMPONENT IS AN OBJECT(OBJECTS ARE HEROES OF OOP),
EVERY OBJECT HAS 2 THINGS:
a. data: which is also called attributes, fields, data members, properties.
b. functions: whichi is also calle methods, behaviors, actions, etc.

For example suppose we have to design an employee management system...
in an object oriented ways.

We would first try to identify different types of objects.
a. Employee
b. Department
c. Project
d. Customers
etc.. etc...
To create each of these objects, we will first have to create a Class for each of them.

Thus we can say that in object oriented programming we always model real world entities
into software objects as well as Object Oriented Programming also offers
a very high level of security.

SYNTAX OF CREATING A CLASS IN JAVA
==================================
//first mention access modifier always, in Java Classes are also public thats possible 
//then write class keyword
//then class name
<access modifier> class <classname>{ // class body start
    <accessmodifier> <datatype> <varname> = <VALUE>; //only in new compilers, like any java one
    <accessmodifier> <datatype> <varname> = <VALUE>;
    ....
    ....
    <access_modifier> <return_type> <method_name>(arg_list){
        //IMPORTANT method body it is javas compulsion, all methods must be writtin inside class bodies.
    }
    ....
} // class body end
DIFFERENCE WITH C++
===================
1 - 
1. in C++ we do not use keywords like public or private with a class
2. in Java, classes can be public however. Benefits discussed in package chapter.

2 - 
1. In turbo C++ we cannot initialize datamembers inside the class
2. But in Java, we CAN initialize data members inside a class.

3 - 
1. Access modifier needs to be mentioned with every variable if it is of
different data type in Java.
if they are n different datatypes, then n different access modifiers for them.
if all the same datatype then just 1 access modifier needed.

4 -
Unlike C++, in Java we do not have method/function declaration.
Rather we directly define a method and that too WITHIN the body of the class
NOT OUTSIDE THE CLASS.

5. In C++, by default all the members of a class are in private mode. But in Java
all members of a class are in default mode.

In C++, by default all members of a class is private
In Java, by devault all members of a class is default.
java has 4 access modifiers, public private protected and default.
This will be learned in packages chapter.
Right now we will only discuess modifiers private and public.

WARNING: KNOW THAT default and public have different behaviors. will learn in package chapter.
Right now we just discuss private and public modifiers. They work the same in Java
as in C++.

==========================================================

DESIGNING THE "Student" CLASS
//understanding, these are like structs of c++
//creating objects for Java classes is important to use the class
// we didn't put name in Student class, because multiple classes
//might need to use the name, so why a name in every one?
//Entity class means object, Student class is entity class
//Then we make public static void main(String[] args)
//Main is also kept in another class, not entity class 
//because if we made Student private, it isn't gonna be accessible


// we make a UseStudent class, called a Driver class.
//If program is a car, driver is Main, so main is Driver class containing Main method.
// before we just made driver classes, now we have Entity classes, and Driver class.
//It's just a methodology from sir, we use. Usually people call it Main class.
//Sir calls it driver class.

class Student{
    int roll;
    char grade;
    double per;
}

class UseStudent{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Student S; //S reference made
        S = new Student(); //An object made of Student in HEAP, size int, char, double --> 14 bytes
        //it is made by new, so put default values in the object in heap.
        // roll = 0, grade = '\o' per = 0.0

        S.roll = 10;
        S.grade = 'A';
        S.per = 76.5

        System.out.println("Roll is: " + S.roll); //changed the default values in S object
        System.out.println("Grade is: " + S.grade);
        System.out.println("Per is" + S.per);

    }
}

Set the Program name UseStudent.java,
because UseStudent contains the Main method.
This is why we named it UseStudent.java 
so the same name is used to compile and run too.
Like javac UseStudent.java for source code file 
And java UseStudent, for the class name that contains main method, which is 
UseStudent class, so class name and source code file same so we don't need
to memorize 2 names.

This program is going against OOP programming, OOPs teaches the right to Access class data
should only be for class functions.

Now we need to make 3 changes in the program for proper object oriented programming
To make them private.
Before they were default which is similar to public but not the same.

they were set as default modifiers.

class Student{
    private int roll;
    private char grade;
    private double per;
}
//code gives 6 syntax errors, that how can you access these,
//they are private.
//if they are changeable properties then theres problems
// if they are not changeable, like length of array, then no problem,
//security is maintained.



class UseStudent{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Student S; //S reference made
        S = new Student(); //An object made of Student in HEAP, size int, char, double --> 14 bytes
        //it is made by new, so put default values in the object in heap.
        // roll = 0, grade = '\o' per = 0.0

        S.roll = 10;
        S.grade = 'A';
        S.per = 76.5

        System.out.println("Roll is: " + S.roll); //changed the default values in S object
        System.out.println("Grade is: " + S.grade);
        System.out.println("Per is" + S.per);

    }
}
