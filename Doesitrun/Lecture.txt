        the concept of modulo, when getting out of the range, it will use
        
        the lower limit of byte is 128 and upper limit is 127 for accosting rotations it also takes 1 value to rotate pos to neg

        then what we do is the formula for moduloing and getting rotations is lowerlimit + upperlimit + 1 then modulo the value of number by that
        and you will get the same answer as if you did the subtractions and rotations all those times.
        
        and if its within the range of lowerlimit + upperlimit then what happens is it simply subtracts that value from the number
